Right now, I'm NOT using the settings.json and tasks.json, along with the "trigger on save" extention. 

I'm using watch.sh, using pandoc to convert from MD to HTML, and the weasyprint from HTML to PDF. I can do the weasyprint command in the terminal, but for some reason it's failing as part of watch.sh.
Failing both with and without the venv
